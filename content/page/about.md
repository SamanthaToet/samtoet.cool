My name is Samantha Toet. I love building things: both on the computer and in real life. I currently work on the business development team at [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/), where I support strategic partner relationships and build sales and marketing dashboards. I also serve as the chair for the [R Consortium R Community Diversity and Inclusion Project](https://www.r-consortium.org/projects/r-community-diversity-and-inclusion) and am the founder/coorganizer of [R-Ladies Charlottesville](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-charlottesville/). In my spare time I enjoy all things rstats (duh), dogs (duh), gardening, and baking.
