I gave a talk at an [R-Ladies Charlottesville](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-charlottesville/) meetup about building dashboards with flexdashboard and how it compares to Shiny. We also explored the fantastic new [Palmer Penguins](https://github.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins) data compiled Kristen Gorman and made available by Allison Horst.
