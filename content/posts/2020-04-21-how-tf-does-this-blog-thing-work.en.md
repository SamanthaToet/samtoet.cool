Hugo, Netlify, blogdown, oh my! When I first sought out to create this blog, I was immediately overwhelmed with the different tools that went into the process. Before diving into the details of each program, I needed to understand the big picture, namely how does each tool contribute to the website creation and deployment work flow and how do they function with eachother? 

As a visual learner, I thought I would make a mental map of the website deployment process. Specifically, what is the procedure for deploying a blogdown website on Netlify, and how does Hugo fit in there?

Below is the diagram I've come up with, that helps me best grok this whole blog creation process:
